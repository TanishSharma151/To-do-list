# To-do-list
I'm thrilled to share that I’ve created a fully functional To-Do List using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript, packed with powerful features designed to make task management a breeze!

📝 Key Features:

1. Add Tasks Effortlessly: Easily add tasks with a minimum of 5 characters for clarity and focus.
2. Search with Precision: Find specific tasks quickly with the search functionality.
3. Custom Task Ordering: Organize your tasks by choosing to sort from Newest to Oldest or Oldest to Newest.
4. ✏️ Edit on the Go: Edit any task with a simple click, and enjoy the flexibility of a Save Edit or Cancel Edit option.
5. ❌ Delete with Care: Delete individual tasks, or select multiple tasks for deletion with just a few clicks.
6. ⚠️ Alert Before Deletion: To prevent accidental deletions, an alert pops up before any tasks or groups of tasks are removed.
7. 🔢 Dynamic Numbering: No need to worry about task order – the numbering updates automatically as you edit or delete tasks, ensuring everything stays organized.
8. This app is designed to be both user-friendly and efficient, helping you stay on top of your tasks in a visually appealing and seamless way.
